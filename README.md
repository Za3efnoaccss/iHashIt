# iHashIt
iHashIt - hash a string from user input!

***

## Requirements
Python 3, hashlib and console modules

***

## How does it work?
1. User input using
`console.input_alert("iHashIt", "Description of user input")`
and putting it into a variable.

2. Converting user input (which is a string) to a bytearray (I called it bytestring lol) in order to make hashing with user input (string) possible.

3. Using hashlib for the rest.

## HUGE SHOUTOUT to Omz::software for creating Pythonista!
I'm a total noob, but at least I created some cool scripts with it, also using its great documentation!
